        <h1>AI: Where does it fit in?</h1>
        <br>
        <main>
            <p>So, you’ve probably heard the term <strong>AI</strong> tossed around quite a bit lately. Maybe you’ve
                read headlines about it writing stories, generating art, or even coding entire apps (and yes, this blog
                post was <em>not</em> written by one… promise!). But what <em>is</em> AI really—and where does it fit
                into everything we’ve been learning so far?</p>

            <p>AI, or <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>, is exactly what it sounds like: giving computers the
                ability to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. That could mean understanding
                language, recognizing images, playing games, or even making predictions about the future.</p>

            <p>But before we dive into how it works, let’s clear something up: AI isn’t a robot with emotions (at least
                not yet). It’s more like a collection of tools and systems that help computers process information,
                learn from it, and make decisions. You can think of it as a combination of math, logic, and statistics
                all working together to simulate “thinking.”</p>

            <h5 style="font-weight: 600;">A Quick History Lesson</h5>
            <p>The idea of AI actually dates back to the 1950s! Scientists like Alan Turing (yes, <em>that</em> Turing)
                wondered if machines could “think.” This question led to what we now call the <strong>Turing
                    Test</strong>, a famous experiment that asks: can a computer respond so naturally that a human can’t
                tell it apart from another person?</p>

            <p>Over time, researchers developed algorithms—essentially step-by-step procedures—to help computers learn
                patterns and make predictions. For example, in the early days, people tried to teach computers how to
                play chess or solve logical puzzles. Now, AI systems can do things like generate realistic images,
                recommend your next Netflix show, and even help doctors detect diseases earlier.</p>

            <h5 style="font-weight: 600;">The Three Main Types of AI</h5>
            <p>AI can be grouped into three broad categories depending on how “smart” it is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Narrow AI:</strong> The kind we use every day. Think Siri, Google Translate, or Netflix
                    recommendations. These systems are very good at one specific task—but that’s all they can do.</li>
                <li><strong>General AI:</strong> This would be an AI that can perform <em>any</em> intellectual task a
                    human can. We’re not there yet (and might not be for a long time).</li>
                <li><strong>Superintelligent AI:</strong> The theoretical kind that surpasses human intelligence
                    entirely. This one exists only in science fiction… for now.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5 style="font-weight: 600;">So… how does AI actually work?</h5>
            <p>At the heart of most modern AI is a concept called <strong>machine learning</strong>. Instead of
                programming every single rule by hand, developers give the computer data—and the computer figures out
                the patterns on its own.</p>

            <p>Imagine you wanted to teach a computer to recognize pictures of cats. You could show it thousands of
                images labeled “cat” and “not cat.” Over time, it would start learning the common patterns that make up
                a cat: fur texture, ear shape, whiskers, and so on. This is called <strong>training</strong> a model.
            </p>

            <p>Once trained, the model can make predictions—like whether a new image contains a cat or not. It’s a
                little like how humans learn: through repetition, experience, and feedback!</p>

            <img src="./article4_images/ai_cat_training.png" alt="AI training cats vs not cats diagram">

            <h5 style="font-weight: 600;">Different Kinds of Learning</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Supervised learning:</strong> You give the AI examples <em>and</em> the correct answers
                    (like the cat example). The AI “learns” from the labeled data.</li>
                <li><strong>Unsupervised learning:</strong> You only give it data—no answers—and it tries to find
                    patterns on its own (like grouping customers by buying habits).</li>
                <li><strong>Reinforcement learning:</strong> The AI learns by trial and error, getting “rewards” for
                    good results—kind of like how you train a pet!</li>
            </ul>

            <h5 style="font-weight: 600;">Where Does AI Fit in Computer Science?</h5>
            <p>AI is one branch of computer science, just like web development, cybersecurity, or data science. But what
                makes AI special is how it connects to <em>so many other areas</em> at once. It’s used in healthcare,
                finance, education, art, entertainment—you name it!</p>

            <p>Remember when we talked about algorithms and efficiency in our first post? AI builds on those same
                principles. It still relies on data structures, math, and logic—all core computer science concepts. So,
                before diving deep into AI, it helps to have a solid foundation in programming, statistics, and
                problem-solving.</p>

            <h5 style="font-weight: 600;">The Famous "Hello, World!" (AI Edition)</h5>
            <p>When people first learn programming, the classic first step is to print <strong>"Hello, World!"</strong>
                on the screen. It’s a way of saying, “I got my code to run!”—like a programmer’s first victory dance. 🥳
            </p>
            <p>But what would “Hello, World!” look like in AI? It might be something simple like teaching a computer to
                recognize the difference between two objects, or to respond with a short phrase when you greet it.
                Instead of <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>, your program might “learn” that the correct output for a
                greeting input is “Hello, human!”</p>
            <p>It’s the same spirit—celebrating your first working interaction—but now, your code is <em>thinking</em>
                just a little bit.</p>

            <h5 style="font-weight: 600;">AI in Our Everyday Lives</h5>
            <p>Even if you don’t realize it, AI is already all around you. When you ask your phone for directions, when
                Netflix recommends a movie, or when your email filters out spam—AI is working behind the scenes. It’s
                like an invisible helper that quietly makes your life easier (and sometimes a little creepier, depending
                on how many targeted ads you get).</p>

            <p>But AI isn’t just about convenience. It’s helping detect wildfires earlier, translate languages in real
                time, and even assist people with disabilities through speech recognition and accessibility tools.
                That’s where its potential really shines—using technology to make the world a little more inclusive and
                efficient.</p>

            <h5 style="font-weight: 600;">So… should you learn AI?</h5>
            <p>If you’re curious about how computers “think” or how apps like ChatGPT or image generators work, then
                yes—absolutely! AI can seem intimidating at first (it’s a lot of math, data, and algorithms), but the
                beauty of computer science is that everything builds on what you already know. Start small: understand
                logic, learn Python, and get comfortable with how data moves through a program. The rest will start to
                make sense from there.</p>

            <p>AI isn’t replacing computer science—it’s expanding it. And by learning it, you’re joining one of the most
                exciting areas of discovery in technology today.</p>

            <p>In short: AI fits in <em>everywhere</em>—but it also fits right alongside your journey as a computer
                scientist. Who knows? Maybe your “Hello, World!” moment is just the start of something intelligent.</p>
