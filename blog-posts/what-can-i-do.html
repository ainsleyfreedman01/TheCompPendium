    <h1>What can I do with computer science?</h1>
    <br>
    <main>
        <p>Now that you’ve (hopefully!) read the first article about what computer science is, it’s time to delve into some actual applications of the matter! With technology now engrained all around us, it’s unsurprising that there are so many things that we can do with it!</p>

        <p>Let’s take a quick tour through some of the most exciting areas where computer science shows up—chances are, you’ve already interacted with several of these today without even thinking about it!</p>

        <h5 style="font-weight: 600;">Web Development: Bringing Ideas to Life on the Internet</h5>
        <p>Ever visited your favorite website—maybe YouTube, an online store, or your school’s portal—and wondered how it was made? That’s web development in action!</p>

        <p>Web development is the process of building websites and web applications. It ranges from simple personal blogs (similar to this one!) to full-blown platforms like Instagram or Google Docs. There are two main sides to it:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
            <li><strong>Frontend</strong>: What you see and interact with (buttons, images, layouts).</li>
            <li><strong>Backend</strong>: The logic and databases running behind the scenes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Python, Ruby, or Node.js for the backend, developers bring digital experiences to life. Without web development, there’d be no streaming platforms, no online shopping, no memes shared across the world in seconds!</p>
        <p>Like this one!</p>

        <h5 style="font-weight: 600;">Data Analysis: Finding Meaning in the Noise</h5>
        <p>Data is everywhere—from your Spotify listening history to how long people spend on a website. But raw data isn’t that helpful on its own. That’s where data analysis comes in.</p>

        <p>Data analysts use tools like Excel, Python (with libraries like pandas), or R to find patterns and insights in big piles of data. For example:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
            <li>Netflix analyzes viewing habits to recommend shows you might like.</li>
            <li>Sports teams study player stats to fine-tune performance.</li>
            <li>Businesses use customer data to decide what products to sell next.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In short, data analysis helps people make smarter decisions by understanding what the numbers are really saying.</p>

        <h5 style="font-weight: 600;">Software Development & Engineering: Building the Tools We Use Daily</h5>
        <p>This one’s a biggie. Software development is all about creating programs—everything from mobile apps to operating systems.</p>

        <p>Think of:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
            <li>Messaging apps like WhatsApp</li>
            <li>Productivity tools like Microsoft Word or Google Sheets</li>
            <li>Video games like Minecraft or Fortnite</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Software engineers write the code that powers these tools, but they also think about architecture, scalability, and reliability—basically, how to build software that works well, doesn’t crash, and can handle millions of users.</p>

        <p>It’s like being both the architect and the builder of the digital world.</p>

        <h5 style="font-weight: 600;">Machine Learning & Data Science: Teaching Computers to Learn</h5>
        <p>Ever wondered how Google knows what you’re about to search, or how your phone unlocks with your face? That’s machine learning in action!</p>

        <p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence where computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every possible scenario. Data scientists and ML engineers build models that recognize patterns and make predictions.</p>

        <p>Some everyday examples include:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
            <li>Spam filters that keep your inbox clean</li>
            <li>Face recognition on social media</li>
            <li>Recommendation systems on YouTube or TikTok</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Data science goes even broader—using statistical techniques and data-driven modeling to uncover insights, forecast trends, and solve real-world problems like predicting traffic or diagnosing medical conditions.</p>

        <h5 style="font-weight: 600;">Artificial Intelligence: Beyond Human Capabilities</h5>
        <p>Artificial intelligence takes things a step further. It’s not just about learning from data, but about mimicking aspects of human intelligence—understanding language, making decisions, even being creative.</p>

        <p>AI powers many things you might already use today:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
            <li>Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa</li>
            <li>Self-driving cars (like those from Tesla)</li>
            <li>Language translation tools (like Google Translate)</li>
            <li>Chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>AI is reshaping industries like healthcare, finance, and education—and it’s still just getting started.</p>

        <h5 style="font-weight: 600;">Other Cool Applications</h5>
        <p>It doesn’t stop there! Here are a few more places computer science makes waves:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">
            <li><strong>Cybersecurity</strong>: Protecting data and systems from hackers and threats. Think: antivirus software, encryption, and firewalls.</li>
            <li><strong>Embedded Systems</strong>: Code running inside everyday devices—microwaves, cars, washing machines, smart TVs.</li>
            <li><strong>Robotics</strong>: Blending hardware and software to create machines that can move and interact with the world, like robot vacuum cleaners or warehouse robots.</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Computing</strong>: Letting companies store and process data on remote servers (like Google Drive or iCloud) instead of local machines.</li>
        </ul>

        <br />
        <h5 style="font-weight: 600;">In Conclusion…</h5>
        <p>Computer science is more than just coding—it’s about solving problems, creating tools, and shaping the future. Whether you’re passionate about games, data, design, or AI, there’s a place for you in this ever-growing field.</p>

        <p>The digital world doesn’t just appear by magic—it’s built, line by line, by people who once asked the same question that you now know how to answer: <em>What can I do with computer science?</em></p>

        <p>Spoiler alert: a lot!</p>
