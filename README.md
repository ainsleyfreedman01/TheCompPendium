# The CompPendium

The CompPendium is my personal computer science blog where I break down CS concepts in a clear, approachable way while documenting my own learning journey.

Unlike a polished production blog, this is intentionally a **learning-focused project** — meant to grow alongside my skills as a developer and computer science student.

## Purpose

The CompPendium was created to make computer science more accessible to students who may not have strong CS programs or resources at their schools.

Not everyone has access to AP Computer Science, coding clubs, or teachers with programming backgrounds.  
I wanted to create a free, easy-to-understand resource that helps level the playing field for curious learners.

This project aims to:

- Introduce students to the world of computer science in an approachable way  
- Break down intimidating concepts into understandable pieces  
- Provide a self-guided learning resource for students without formal CS education  
- Encourage students to explore computer science regardless of background or access  

It’s both a learning archive and a small step toward making CS education more equitable.

## What Went Into Building It

This project wasn’t just about writing blog posts.  
Most of the work happened behind the scenes.

### What I focused on:
- Organizing technical content in a clear, logical structure  
- Designing a system that makes it easy to add future posts  
- Creating reusable layouts and components  
- Implementing responsive design for different screen sizes  
- Creating a consistent visual identity and theme  
- Making content readable, accessible, and beginner-friendly  
- Structuring files for long-term scalability  

I wanted to understand how a blog works under the hood instead of relying completely on fully prebuilt CMS platforms.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Bootstrap

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js

### Other Tools & Technologies
- Git + GitHub for version control  
- GitHub Pages for hosting  
- Markdown for drafting content  
- Responsive design principles  

Bootstrap helped speed up layout and responsiveness while still allowing me to customize the design and structure manually.

## Development Process

I treated this like a real software project, not just a writing exercise.

Some things I deliberately practiced:
- Designing reusable UI components  
- Separating layout, content, and styling  
- Maintaining consistency across posts  
- Building with scalability in mind  
- Writing clean, organized files  
- Thinking about how beginners actually learn technical concepts  

Each post doubled as both a blog entry and a design iteration.

## Writing Philosophy

My goal with The CompPendium is to:

- Explain concepts without gatekeeping  
- Start with intuition before jumping into formal definitions  
- Use simple language before technical language  
- Include examples and visuals when possible  
- Write like I’m teaching it to someone just starting out  

The blog is meant to feel supportive, not intimidating.

## What I Learned

This project helped me build skills in:

- Technical communication  
- Frontend design and layout  
- Organizing large content-based projects  
- Thinking about accessibility in education  
- Translating complex ideas into simple explanations  
- Long-term project planning  

It helped me grow as both a programmer and an educator.

## Future Goals

Some directions I’d love to take The CompPendium:

- Interactive visualizations and simulations  
- Quizzes and practice problems  
- Deeper dives into algorithms and data structures  
- Beginner roadmaps for different CS topics  
- Improved accessibility features
